# Founders Directory

Through this project I was introduced to Swift and iOS programming. I was able to use some of my previous knowledge of mobile development and translate it to this new platform. There was some overlap, but a lot of the process required reading and doing some research. I finished all of the required parts, according to the rubric, and I believe I built a robust application. I used several types of ViewControllers, such as Table, Navigation and Collection (then deciding against it). I believe I correctly implemented the MVC pattern, separating responsibilities to their respective sections.

In regards to things I want to work on in the future, I want to keep learning about Auto Layout, which I tried to implement in this project. The UI works perfectly for iPhone X, but for other models, there is one UIImageView in the ProfileViewController which is chopped off, so starting next project, I want to make sure I test new views with different models of iOS devices. 
Also, I want to learn how to implement authentication. I attempted to do so using Google's Sign In API, but was not able to get it to work. I learned about Pods in the process, so I believe the struggle was worth it. 
I also want to learn how to store data on the phone, whether it be the list of founders, for example, or images selected by the user. I am curious to know what type of storage Apple recommends.
